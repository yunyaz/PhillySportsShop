# Philly Sports Shop

## Overview

The objective of this project is to design and develop an online shopping website that sells sports gear for major sports teams in Philadelphia. Sports fans are usually fans of several local sports teams, so this website will allow customers to purchase sports gear products for different sports teams at one website. The website will have a user-friendly interface that will enable users to browse products based on teams, search for products, view product descriptions, add products to their cart, and complete the checkout process.

## Tech stack
Front-end:

HTML and CSS are used to create the website's layout and design. HTML defines the structure of the website, and CSS styles the website's visual appearance.

JavaScript is used to create interactive elements on the website.

Back-end:

Java is used as the programming language to build the website's backend functionality. It handles business logic and can interact with databases.

Spring Boot is used to create web applications and manages many of the underlying dependencies and configurations. Spring Boot also handles security, authentication, and authorization.

MySQL is used as the database to store the website's data.
